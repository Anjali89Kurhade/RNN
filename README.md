# RNN
Recurrent neural networks recognize data's sequential characteristics and use patterns to predict the next likely scenario
A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a type of artificial neural network which uses sequential data or time series data
Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) are a type of Neural Network where the output from previous step are fed as input to the current step.
In traditional neural networks, all the inputs and outputs are independent of each other, but in cases like when it is required to predict the next word of a sentence, the previous words are required and hence there is a need to remember the previous words.
RNN came into existence, which solved this issue with the help of a Hidden Layer. The main and most important feature of RNN is Hidden state, which remembers some information about a sequence.
